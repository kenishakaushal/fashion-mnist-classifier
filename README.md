This is a basic project that uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a neural network that can recognize different types of clothing in the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset includes items like shirts, shoes, and dresses.
This project trains a simple neural network to classify images of clothing. Each image is grayscale (black and white) and 28x28 pixels. The model tries to predict which category each item belongs to. There are 10 categories in total.
